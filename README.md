A simple Java application that simulates the table layout view used in caf√© and restaurant POS systems.  
It allows users to create, move, and edit tables, then save and load their layout.

## Future Improvements
- Database connection for orders/articles
- Table status (occupied/free)
- Integrate with real POS logic
- Add GUI polish (icons, snapping, grid)
